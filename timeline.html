  <h3><u> 1990 </u></h3>
  <h4> Nike Air Max 90 </h4>
  <p> Originally dubbed the Air Max 3, The Nike Air Max 90 completely reworked the Air Max sneaker for the new decade. Still today, the Air Max 90 is one of the most popular sneakers in the world. </p>

    <h3> 1991 </h3>
    <h4> Nike Air Classic BW </h4>  
    <p> One incredibly important element to the greatness of Air Max is the fact that there are so many OG colourways that are now iconic, such as the Persian Violet OG iteration of the Nike Air Max BW. - Zack
    The Nike Air Classic BW was originally a sleeker version of the Air Max 90 with a bigger Air window (yes, the BW really does stand for ‘Big Window’). Most recently, the Nike Air Max BW has been updated with a full-length Air sole borrowed from the Air Max 97. First seen on a SKAir model by Skepta; we think the changes majorly upgrade the sneaker.</p>

    <h3> 1995 </h3>
    <h4> Nike Air Max 95 </h4>
    <p> A sneaker of subtle branding and striking form; the Sergio Lozano designed Air Max 95 was created with the human anatomy in mind (a fun fact which seems simultaneously cool and slightly gross). It’s important to note that the Air Max 95 marks an important milestone in the Nike Air Max timeline as the complete overhaul in design signifies the brand’s confidence in its relationship with their consumer. In short: by ‘95, they had us. </p>

    <h3> 1998 </h3>
    <h4> Nike AirMax Plus </h4>
    <p> lorida: the location where Sean McDowell first envisioned a sneaker that drew inspiration from the beach. Palm trees swaying, colours of the sunset and sealife are all translated through design upon the Air Max Plus (better known as the Nike TN). It’s ironic then that the sneaker proved most popular in gloomy London. Why? Perhaps the vibrant sneaker was a form of escapism.</p>
